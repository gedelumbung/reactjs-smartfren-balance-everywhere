# Smartfren Balance (Everywhere)

### Attach Your Current Smartfren Balance in Every Browser Page

This is just another version of [this Chrome Extension](https://github.com/gedelumbung/reactjs-smartfren-balance) to check your current Smartfren balance, no need to click the icon to show your current balance. It will automatically show in every browser page.

### Why I need this (maybe you too :D)?

I have no time to click the extension everytime only to checking the current balance, so I just need to attach it in every browser page (inside body tag) and it will call official API to fetch all data :D
